# Formatting Suggestion

(applies to both Capstone Project 1 and 2)

## Font

- 12pt

## Paragraph Formatting

- Line spacing of 1.25 to 1.5

## Sectioning

- Chapter (1) - Section (1.1) - Subsection (1.1.1)
- Chapter starts from a new page

## Labelling

- All tables and figures should be labelled and captioned
- Captions for tables should be above the table
- Captions for figures should be below the figure
- Refer to table/figure from paragraphs using the label (for e.g. Table 1) instead of position (the table below, the figure above, etc.)

## Citation Format

- Be consistent
- Preferably IEEE
